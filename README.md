## Introduction

This code runs an interactive web app called **Classic Arcade Game Clone**. The original [starter code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) was created by Udacity, for a course project assessment. The objective of this project from the student perspective, was to write further code, to fulfil the additional Udacity requirements listed at the website link, in the [Background](#background) section.


## App specifics

When this project is complete, you will have a Player and Enemies (bugs).
The objective of the game, is for the player to reach the water, without colliding into any of the enemies. Key aspects of the game are as follows:
* The player can move left, right, up and down by using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
* The enemies automatically move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board.
* Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game ends and is immediately reset, with the player being moved back to the starting square.
* Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won and a congratulations screen appears, offering the option to restart the game.
Features will be added via the issue log until the project is complete.
